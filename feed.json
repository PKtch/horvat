Why is everyone so obsessed with the Apocalypse? How can we explain the success of TV series like 'Chernobyl', phenomena such as 'dark tourism' or what Horvat calls the 'commodification of the Apocalypse'? Why do some people empathize with the burning of Notre Dame and the flooding of Venice but not with other major catastrophies? What can popular culture and place-making, climate crisis and nuclear disasters tell us about the Apocalypse, and what can the notion of 'the end' teach us about constructing a different future? While everyone is worried about the coming end, Horvat offers us glimpses of the possible futures.After the Apocalypse, a book of science-fiction philosophy, leads us on a whirlwind tour from different actually existing places like the exclusion zone of Chernobyl and the quickly changing Mediterranean to the imaginary places of the future.\n  </p>",

To general observers, the European Union's economic woes appear to be its greatest problem, but the real peril is an ongoing ideological–political crisis that threatens an era of instability and reactionary brutality.<br><br>The fall of communism in 1989 seemed to end the leftist program of universal emancipation. However, nearly a quarter of a century later, the European Union has failed to produce any coherent vision that can mobilize people to action. Until recently, the only ideology receptive to European workers has been the nationalist call to \"defend\" against immigrant integration. Today, Europe is focused on regulating the development of capitalism and promoting a reactionary conception of its cultural heritage. Yet staying these courses, Žižek and Horvat show, only strips Europe of its power and stifles its political ingenuity. The best hope is for Europe to revive and defend its legacy of universal egalitarianism, which benefits all parties by preserving the promise of equal representation.\n  </p>",

By going back to the sexual revolution of the October Revolution and its subsequent repression, to Che�s dilemma between love and revolutionary commitment and to the period of �68 (from communes to terrorism) and its commodification in late capitalism, the Croatian philosopher Srecko Horvat gives a possible answer to the question of why it is that the most radical revolutionaries like Lenin or Che were scared of the radicality of love. What is so radical about a seemingly conservative notion of love and why is it anything but conservative?<br><br>This short book is a modest contribution to the current upheavals around the world - from Tahrir to Taksim, from Occupy Wall Street to Hong Kong, from Athens to Sarajevo - in which the question of love is curiously, surprisingly, absent.\n  </p>",

To solve them, he argues in this passionate call for a new radical internationalism, we must move beyond existing ways of thinking: beyond borders, national identities and the redundant narratives of the past. Only in this way can we create new models for living and, together, shape a more open and optimistic future.\n  </p>",
